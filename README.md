# __Stock Price Prediction using Data-Mining-And-Machine-Learning
This project presents a day-to-day analysis on Stock data and determine stock price prediction using machine learning models by five different methods, 
namely Linear Regression algorithm, Support vector machine algorithm, Long-short term memory algorithm, K-nearest neighbor algorithm,
Autoregressive integrated moving average algorithm. The predictive models are built using this machine algorithms on historical stock data that is collected from Yahoo finance. Every predictive model’s output is according to actual price of stock.  
This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, that helps us to get structured approach for data-mining process.<br>
CRISP-DM also help us to implement project which can help us with business understanding, data knowledge, data preparation, data modelling, implementing machine learning models 
which results in getting livestock market investments, evaluation of models and deployment.<br>
To determine the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models in performing the stock price prediction in this project we tried to get the performance metrics like root mean-squared error (RMSE) and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). 
The results show us that this machine learning and deep learning models provides better estimation for future stock price prediction.<br>

## __Introduction__
Stock price prediction has many huge ranges of variables that affect the estimation of stock price prediction.<br>
This report aims to improve the method and speed up the process of stock price prediction for better investment by performing the comparative analysis 
using machine learning algorithms.  
In this project we have used Linear regression algorithm which helps to identify linear relationships in data ,
SVM   Algorithm helps to perform better with high dimensional data and  in non-linear classification, K-nearest neighbor Algorithm, 
LSTM algorithm helps to understand long term dependencies and patterns in sequential data,
ARIMA algorithm is used to perform prediction of stock prices that are applied to major automotive companies such as  Toyota, Ferrari and Honda Motor’s .<br>
These automotive companies are identified and chosen as they have their significant impact on automotive industry and these industries have the historical stock price data. 
This project aims to perform comparative analysis across different stocks and understand strengths and limitations in market conditions.<br> 
To handle complex dependencies and to understand the linear trends from the data these algorithms were chosen. The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate the performance of chosen machine learning algorithms for stock price analysis and to achieve the insights into its limitations of each algorithm in context of stock price prediction by using real time stock data [3].  
This project finds an experimental result by comparative analysis metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage error (MAPE). <br>
This project aims to contribute to the understanding of the ML algorithms for forecasting stock prices and assist the stake holders
to take decisions based on the predictive analytics. <br> 
In this project, we also tried to review the previous research implemented to predict the stock price analysis using machine learning algorithms 
to understand the scope and deep understanding of knowledge to implement stock price predictions. 
We have also outlined the methodology and followed CRISP-DM methodology to implement stock price predictions using machine learning algorithms
which includes collecting and loading data, data pre-processing, applying machine learning models and evaluation metrics. <br>
In this project we have also interpreted results that signify the accuracy in stock price predictions.<br>
